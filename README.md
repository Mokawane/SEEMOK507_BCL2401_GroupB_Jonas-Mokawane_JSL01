**Pet Adoption Syntax Validator**

This project is based in Javascript validation index

I used validation function to check whether the input consists of the required name format

and for that i applied regex to check if either the name format starts with pet_ and followed by 4 digits for a year standard, from year 2018 to year 2024 and letters after.
